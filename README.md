# Computer-Science-for-JavaScript-Challenge-Regex-Tutorial

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

I have chosen an email matching regex: 

    /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
